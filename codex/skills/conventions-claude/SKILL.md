# Claude Code Conventions

Tool-specific overlay for Claude Code plugin artifacts. Loaded by the scorer and checker when an artifact is classified as **Tier 2-Claude** (per `agents/scorer.md` step 3). The universal floor lives in `nlpm:conventions`; this overlay adds Claude-Code-specific schemas on top.

## 1. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

The plugin manifest.

**Required fields:**
- `name` — string, kebab-case, unique identifier

**Optional fields:**
- `version` — semver string (e.g. `"0.1.0"`). If omitted, commit SHA is used (every commit = new version). For stable releases, set explicit semver.
- `description` — one-line summary
- `author` — object: `{ "name": "...", "email": "...", "url": "..." }`
- `homepage` — URL string
- `repository` — URL string or object
- `license` — SPDX identifier
- `keywords` — string array for discovery
- `agent` — sets the default agent when the plugin is enabled
- `category` — marketplace category (e.g. `"developer-tools"`)

**Component path fields (all optional, string or string[]):**
- `commands` — path(s) to command markdown files
- `agents` — path(s) to agent markdown files
- `skills` — path(s) to skill directories
- `hooks` — path to hooks.json
- `mcpServers` — path(s) to MCP server config
- `lspServers` — path(s) to LSP server config (stable in 2026)
- `outputStyles` — path(s) to output style definitions

**Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "0.2.1",
  "description": "Does useful things",
  "author": { "name": "dev" },
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["tools", "productivity"],
  "commands": "commands/",
  "agents": "agents/",
  "skills": "skills/"
}
```

---

## 2. Commands and Skills — merged surfaces (v2.1.x change)

**Critical:** as of Claude Code v2.1.x, commands and skills are the **same architecture**. Both surfaces support the same frontmatter and execution semantics. The recommended canonical path is:

```
.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md     # preferred for new development
.claude/commands/<name>.md         # still works; equivalent behavior
```

Existing `.claude/commands/` files continue to function. New code should prefer the skill layout because it allows companion files (`scripts/`, `references/`, `examples/`) in the same directory.

**Authoritative reference:** <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands>

### 2.1 Frontmatter (shared between commands and skills)

**Required:**
- `description` — string; explains what it does and when to invoke. Combined with `when_to_use:` if present.

**Optional (universal):**
- `name` — string; per official docs, **explicitly optional**. When omitted, filename or enclosing directory is used. Pre-v0.7.15 nlpm incorrectly flagged missing `name:` as a bug; corrected after Jeffallan/claude-skills#184 maintainer feedback.
- `argument-hint` — string; placeholder shown in UI (e.g., `"[path]"`)
- `arguments` — space-separated or YAML list of named arguments for `$name` substitution (e.g., `"issue branch"`)
- `allowed-tools` — string array OR space-separated string; pre-approved tools (no per-use prompt). Format: `"Read Grep Bash(git *)"` or `["Read", "Grep"]`.
- `model` — `haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus`; overrides session model for one turn.
- `effort` — `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`; overrides session effort.
- `user-invocable` — boolean; `false` hides from menu (only Claude invokes).
- `disable-model-invocation` — boolean; `true` means only the user invokes (manual `/skill-name` only).

**Optional (v2.1.x additions — NEW since pre-2026 conventions):**
- `when_to_use` — string; additional trigger hints (appends to description)
- `context` — `"fork"` runs in a forked subagent (isolates from main history)
- `agent` — which subagent type (built-in: `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`)
- `hooks` — `{...}` skill-scoped hooks (same shape as settings.json hooks)
- `paths` — glob patterns; auto-load only for matching files (e.g., `"src/**/*.ts,lib/**/*.ts"`)
- `shell` — `bash` (default) or `powershell` for `!`cmd`` blocks

### 2.2 Body conventions

- Write imperative instructions directed at Claude (not the user)
- Use numbered steps for multi-phase workflows
- Reference shared partials by relative path: `commands/shared/name.md`
- Define expected output format explicitly in the body

### 2.3 Dynamic context injection

- `` !`git diff HEAD` `` — runs command before Claude sees the skill; replaces line with output.
- ` ```! ` fenced blocks — multi-line commands.
- Disabled if `"disableSkillShellExecution": true` in settings.

---

## 3. Shared Partials

Reusable command fragments located in `commands/shared/`.

**Rules:**
- MUST include `user-invocable: false` in frontmatter — prevents appearing as top-level commands
- MUST have a `description` stating their purpose as a partial
- Referenced by full relative path from the consuming command file
- Can contain any mix of instructions, templates, or decision logic

---

## 4. Agent Frontmatter

Agents live in `.claude/agents/<name>.md`.

**Documented fields:**
- `name` — string; identifier for invocation
- `description` — string; critical for reliable triggering — should contain 3+ specific phrases describing when to use this agent
- `system-prompt` — string (block scalar); custom system instructions

**Convention fields (strongly recommended):**
- `model` — `haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus`
- `effort` — `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`
- `color` — one of `cyan`, `blue`, `magenta`, `yellow`, `green`, `red`; visual label
- `tools` — tools the agent body uses; two valid formats:
  - JSON array: `tools: ["Read", "Glob"]`
  - Comma-separated string: `tools: Read, Glob, Grep`
- `tool-restrictions` — alternative to `tools:`; `{ allow: [...], deny: [...] }`
- `skills` — preload skill content into this agent's context at startup. Two valid formats:
  - JSON array: `skills: ["nlpm:conventions"]`
  - YAML list: `skills:\n  - nlpm:conventions`

**Best practice: include `<example>` blocks in description.** Two or more `<example>` blocks with diverse scenarios is the minimum for reliable triggering.

---

## 5. Skills — Claude Code path conventions

Universal SKILL.md spec lives in `nlpm:conventions` (open spec at agentskills.io). Claude Code uses these path conventions:

- Single plugin skill: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Multi-skill plugin: `skills/<plugin>/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Project-scoped: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- User-scoped: `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

**Skill discovery paths now support parent-directory and monorepo nested scanning** (v2.1.x). Skills from `./parent/.claude/skills/` and `./packages/frontend/.claude/skills/` auto-load. Skills from `--add-dir` paths also load from `.claude/skills/` within added directories.

**Supporting files:** Same directory as `SKILL.md` — `scripts/`, `references/`, `examples/`, etc. Reference them from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows when to load them.

**Skill preloading in agents (v2.1.x):** Declare `skills: [name1, name2]` in agent frontmatter to inject full skill content at startup (vs. Claude auto-loading on demand).

---

## 6. Rules

Rules live in `.claude/rules/<name>.md`.

**Frontmatter:**
- `description` — string (required)
- `paths` — string array (optional); glob patterns scoping which files this rule applies to

**Body format:**
- Lead with a **bold imperative**: `**Always do X.**` or `**Use Y instead of Z.**`
- Follow immediately with rationale
- Be specific and testable
- State what to DO, not only what to avoid (Pink Elephant effect)

**Budget:** Under 500 lines total per rules file.

**Naming convention for ordered sets:** `NN-kebab-name.md` (e.g. `01-formatting.md`).

---

## 7. Hook Events (Claude Code)

Hook events are **case-sensitive**. Using wrong case silently ignores the hook.

**Confirmed against 2026-05 docs refresh:**

| Event | Trigger | Context fields |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Session begin | `source` (startup/resume/clear/compact), `model` |
| `SessionEnd` | Session end | (trigger only) |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User submits a prompt | `prompt` text |
| `PreToolUse` | Before any tool call | `tool_name`, `tool_input` |
| `PostToolUse` | After tool call | `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_output` |
| `PermissionRequest` | When Claude requests permission | `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `permission_mode` |
| `Stop` | Once per turn | `reason` (can set `decision: block` to prevent stopping) |
| `StopFailure` | Once per turn — Claude failed to complete | `reason` |
| `FileChanged` | Per file change | `filename`, `watcher_path` |

**Present in older conventions docs, status uncertain in current docs — verify before flagging:**
`SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `Notification`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `InstructionsLoaded`, `TaskCompleted`. nlpm should NOT penalize these as "unknown" until verified against current `code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md`.

**Hook types** (canonical, all lowercase in JSON):
- `command` — shell script (stdin/stdout)
- `http` — HTTP POST endpoint
- `mcp_tool` — MCP server tool invocation
- `prompt` — LLM evaluation
- `agent` — subagent verification

**Matcher patterns:** string (exact), pipe-separated list (`Bash|Edit`), or regex (non-alphanumeric chars).

**MCP tool naming:** `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (e.g., `mcp__memory__write.*`). Hook matchers use this format.

**Exit codes (command hooks):**
- `0` — success (stdout as JSON or context)
- `2` — blocking error (action denied, stderr shown)
- `1, 3+` — non-blocking (logged in debug only)

---

## 8. `hooks.json` Format

Located at `.claude/hooks.json` or `<plugin>/hooks/hooks.json`.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pre-write-check.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "You are now in strict TDD mode."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Structure rules:**
- Top-level key: `"hooks"`
- Second-level keys: event names (case-sensitive)
- Each event maps to an array of matcher objects: `{ "matcher": "<regex>", "hooks": [...] }`
- Each hook object: `{ "type": "command"|"http"|"mcp_tool"|"prompt"|"agent", "<type-field>": "..." }`
- Field name matches the type: `"command"` for type `command`, `"prompt"` for type `prompt`, etc.

---

## 9. `.mcp.json`

Claude Code reads MCP server registrations from a **standalone JSON file** at the repo root (NOT embedded in `settings.json` like Gemini, NOT inside `config.toml` like Codex).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Plugin scope: `<plugin>/.claude-plugin/.mcp.json` or `<plugin>/.mcp.json` (path per `plugin.json`).

---

## 10. CLAUDE.md (memory file)

Project-scoped: `CLAUDE.md` at repo root, plus optional `.claude/memory/*.md`. User-scoped: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

**Recommended pattern for multi-tool projects** (per `analysis/multi-tool-design-2026-05.md` decision #5): use a one-line `CLAUDE.md` that imports `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
@AGENTS.md
```

This makes AGENTS.md the canonical universal memory file. AGENTS.md is what Codex reads natively; Gemini/Antigravity can be configured to read it via `context.fileName` array. This is how nlpm itself works.

**Body conventions** when content lives in CLAUDE.md directly:
- Build/run instructions
- Test commands
- Architecture overview (what lives where)
- Prerequisites section
- Valid `@`-imports must reference existing files

---

## 11. `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json`

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `permissions` | Permission policy (allow/deny rules, modes) |
| `hooks` | Hook event registrations (alternative to `hooks/hooks.json` for project-scoped hooks) |
| `model` | Default model selection |
| `theme` | UI theme |
| `disableSkillShellExecution` | If `true`, disables `!`...`` and ` ```! ` dynamic blocks in skills |

**Rule:** `.local.json` is gitignored (per-user); the non-local file is shared. NEVER set `bypassPermissions: true` in the shared file.

---

## 12. LSP Servers (`.lsp.json`)

**Stable in 2026 (was experimental in 2025).** Plugin-level LSP server registrations.

Schema details out of scope for this version; PR-B trigger: when scoring shows LSP-related findings appearing in audits, add a dedicated subsection here. Until then, scorer recognizes presence of `.lsp.json` and validates JSON-parse only.

---

## 13. Monitors (`monitors/monitors.json`)

**Stable in 2026 (was experimental in 2025).** Plugin-level background watchers (logs, files, status).

Schema details out of scope for this version (same staging as LSP). Scorer validates JSON-parse only.

---

## 14. Reference Syntax

**Commands referencing shared partials:**
```
<!-- Include: commands/shared/discover.md -->
```
Or by instruction: "Follow the steps in commands/shared/discover.md"

**Agents referencing skills in frontmatter:**
```yaml
skills: ["nlpm:conventions", "nlpm:conventions-claude"]
```

**Hooks referencing scripts:**
```json
"command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check.sh"
```

**Always use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for intra-plugin file references.** Hardcoded absolute paths break portability.

**Cross-plugin skill references** use the same `plugin:skill` format. The plugin must be installed for the reference to resolve.

---

## 15. Memory File Conventions (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`)

Claude Code writes per-project persistent memory at `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/memory/`.

**Index file:** `MEMORY.md` (no frontmatter; one-line-per-entry index).

**Individual memory files** MUST include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: "short identifier"
description: "one-line summary"
type: user | feedback | project | reference
---
```

**`type` values:**

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `user` | Preferences, habits, or facts about the user |
| `feedback` | Corrections or lessons from past sessions |
| `project` | Project-specific facts, decisions, or context |
| `reference` | External reference material copied into memory |

**Rules:**
- Every memory file must appear in `MEMORY.md` (orphans are flagged).
- `MEMORY.md` itself is the index; not scored as a memory file.
- Memory files should not reference removed files or functions.

---

## 16. Claude Code Tool Catalog

Tool names valid in `tools:` and `allowed-tools:`. Do NOT flag any as "undocumented" or "unknown".

**Built-in tools:**
- File I/O: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`
- Discovery: `Glob`, `Grep`
- Execution: `Bash`, `BashOutput`, `KillBash`
- Agent: `Task`
- Web: `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`
- User interaction: `AskUserQuestion`
- Planning: `TodoWrite`
- Commands: `SlashCommand`
- Scheduling: `ScheduleWakeup`
- Skill invocation: `Skill`
- Tool discovery: `ToolSearch`

**MCP tools:** `mcp__<server-name>__<tool-name>` (e.g., `mcp__mermaider__validate_syntax`).

Tool names are case-sensitive. Any string matching the patterns above is a valid tool reference regardless of whether this document pre-dates the tool's introduction.

---

## 17. Plugin distribution

**Marketplace manifest:** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the marketplace repo root. Schema:

```json
{
  "name": "marketplace-name",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "owner/repo"
      },
      "description": "...",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "author": { "name": "..." },
      "repository": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
      "license": "MIT",
      "category": "developer-tools"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Plugin from URL (v2.1.x):** `--plugin-url` and `--plugin-dir` flags accept `.zip` archives.

**Namespacing:** Skills are namespaced (`/my-plugin:hello`). Commands and agents use short names. Prevents conflicts between plugins.

---

## 18. Scope and uncertainty

This skill covers Claude Code conventions. It does NOT cover:
- Universal SKILL.md spec → `nlpm:conventions`
- Penalty tables → `nlpm:scoring`

**Uncertainties flagged for verification:**
- `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `Notification`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `InstructionsLoaded`, `TaskCompleted` — present in older nlpm conventions, status in current docs unverified (PR-B refresh did not enumerate them).
- LSP server schema (`.lsp.json`) — stable but no detailed field list captured.
- Monitor schema (`monitors/monitors.json`) — same.
