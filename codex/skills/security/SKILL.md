# Security Scan Patterns for Claude Code Plugins

## Context-Aware File Classification

Before assigning severity to any finding, classify the file by its execution context:

| File Type | Examples | Can Execute? | Rule |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------|
| Shell scripts | `*.sh`, `*.bash` | Yes | Apply full severity table |
| Code files | `*.py`, `*.js`, `*.mjs`, `*.ts` | Yes | Apply full severity table |
| Hook definitions | `hooks/hooks.json` | Runs on every tool call | Apply full severity table |
| MCP configs | `.mcp.json` | Yes (server launch) | Apply full severity table |
| Package manifests | `package.json` | Via npm scripts | Apply full severity table |
| Documentation | `*.md` (SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md) | **No** | Cap at Low — see rule below |

### Documentation Files (*.md)

Patterns in `.md` files are instructional content, not executable code. A `curl | bash` in a README documents a user action the reader types manually — the plugin never runs it. Apply this rule universally:

**Any Critical or High pattern found in a `.md` file → downgrade to Low (informational).** Note it as "instructional content in documentation — not executable."

Examples:
- `curl https://... | bash` in README.md → Low: install instruction for end users
- `eval $var` in SKILL.md → Low: pattern shown as example to avoid
- `new Function(...)` in CLAUDE.md → Low: educational reference

Exception: if a `.md` file is explicitly referenced as a script via `command:` in `hooks.json` or executed via `bash file.md`, treat it as executable and apply full severity.

## Scanning Workflow

1. **Classify files** — categorize each file by execution context (see table above)
2. **Identify execution surfaces** — map hooks, scripts, MCP configs, commands, and install scripts
3. **Scan each surface** — apply pattern tables below, matching regex against file contents
4. **Apply context adjustments** — downgrade documentation findings to Low per the markdown rule
5. **Validate findings** — verify each Critical/High finding is in an executable context before finalizing
6. **Generate report** — produce the structured report (see Report Format section)

## Execution Surfaces

Claude Code plugins have five execution surfaces that must be scanned:

| Surface | Files | Risk Level | Why |
|---------|-------|------------|-----|
| Hooks | `hooks/hooks.json`, referenced scripts | Critical | Runs on EVERY tool call automatically |
| Scripts | `scripts/*.sh`, `*.py`, `*.js` | High | Executed by commands/agents |
| MCP Servers | `.mcp.json` | High | Network access, data flow |
| Bash in commands | `commands/*.md` with Bash tool | Medium | Shell execution via Claude |
| Install scripts | `package.json` postinstall, setup scripts | Medium | Runs on install |

## Dangerous Shell Patterns

### Critical (immediate risk)

| Pattern | Regex | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Pipe to shell | `curl.*\|.*sh`, `wget.*\|.*bash` | Remote code execution |
| Eval with variables | `eval\s+["']?\$` | Arbitrary code execution |
| Reverse shell | `bash\s+-i\s+>&`, `/dev/tcp/` | Backdoor |
| Base64 decode and exec | `base64.*\|.*sh`, `base64.*\|.*python` | Obfuscated execution |
| SSH key exfiltration | `cat.*\.ssh/`, `scp.*\.ssh/` | Key theft |
| Token exfiltration | Secrets like GITHUB_TOKEN or API keys sent to curl/wget | Credential theft |

### High (likely dangerous)

| Pattern | Regex | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Subprocess with shell=True | `subprocess\.(call\|run\|Popen).*shell\s*=\s*True` | Unsanitized input reaches shell |
| OS system calls | `os\.system\(` | No argument escaping; full shell interpretation |
| Dynamic require/import | `require\(\s*\$`, `import\(\s*\$` | Attacker-controlled module path |
| new Function with dynamic string | `new Function\(` with string concatenation or template literal | Arbitrary code execution from string; often used to deserialize data that could be imported directly |
| File write outside repo | `> ~/`, `> /etc/`, `> /tmp/.*\.sh` | System modification |
| Sudo usage | `sudo\s+` | Privilege escalation |
| PATH modification | Appending to bashrc, zshrc, or profile | Persistent system modification |

### Medium (context-dependent)

| Pattern | Regex | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Network calls | `curl\s+`, `wget\s+`, `fetch\(`, `requests\.(get\|post)` | Could exfiltrate repo data to external host |
| Environment access | `process\.env`, `os\.environ`, shell variable expansion | May leak tokens, keys, or secrets |
| File reads outside repo | Reading from home directory or system paths | Exposes credentials or configs outside project |
| Runtime package install | `npm install`, `pip install`, `gem install` | Unvetted dependency pulled at runtime |
| Shell exec functions | Functions that execute strings as shell commands | String-to-shell boundary; injection risk |

## MCP Configuration Risks

Scan `.mcp.json` for:

| Risk | Check | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| Remote servers | `url` field pointing to non-localhost | High |
| Unknown domains | Domain not in known-safe list | High |
| Broad permissions | `permissions` with wildcard or extensive list | Medium |
| File system access | Server with `fs` or `filesystem` capability | Medium |
| Shell access | Server with `shell` or execution capability | Critical |
| Missing auth | Remote server without `auth` field | High |

Known-safe MCP domains: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `modelcontextprotocol.io`, `github.com`, `api.anthropic.com`

## Hook Safety Rules

Scan `hooks/hooks.json` for:

| Risk | Check | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| Hook runs shell script | `command` field references `.sh`, `.py`, `.js` | Medium (must scan the script) |
| Hook uses user input | Script receives prompt or input variables without sanitization | High |
| Hook on every event | Triggers on PreToolUse or PostToolUse without tool filter | Medium |
| Hook modifies files | Script writes to disk on every tool call | Medium |
| Hook makes network calls | Script contains network request commands | High |

## Dependency Supply Chain

Scan `package.json` for:

| Risk | Check | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| postinstall scripts | `scripts.postinstall` exists | High |
| preinstall scripts | `scripts.preinstall` exists | High |
| Git URL dependencies | Deps pointing to git URLs | Medium |
| Unpinned versions | Wildcard or "latest" version (suppress if lockfile present: package-lock.json, bun.lock, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml) | Medium |

Scan `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` for:

| Risk | Check | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| Git URL deps | git+https or git+ssh URLs | Medium |
| Unpinned | No version pin | Low |
| Direct URL | HTTP download URLs | High |

## Prompt Injection Surfaces

| Risk | Check | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| Untrusted file content in prompts | Agent reads arbitrary file then uses content in Bash | High |
| User input passed to shell | Command takes arguments and passes to Bash without sanitization | Critical |
| Template expansion | Variable expansion in hook scripts with user-controlled values | High |

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Critical | Immediate exploitation risk: RCE, credential theft, backdoor | Block contribution, file security issue |
| High | Likely dangerous: shell injection, data exfil, privilege escalation | Block contribution, report in audit |
| Medium | Context-dependent: network calls, env access, runtime installs | Report in audit, flag for review |
| Low | Minor concern: unpinned deps, broad permissions | Report as informational |

## Pre-Match Context Filter (apply BEFORE flagging)

Before generating ANY Critical or High finding from the pattern tables
above, verify the matched pattern is in **executable position** — not
quoted text being displayed, documented, echoed, or used as test data.
This filter applies universally to **every** Critical/High pattern in
this skill, not just `curl | bash`. The audit data has shown the same
class of false positives across `SEC-curl-pipe-sh`, `SEC-new-function-eval`,
`SEC-eval-with-variables`, and `SEC-base64-decode-and-exec` — pattern
syntactically present in the file, but in a string context where the
shell or interpreter never parses it as code.

**Drop the finding silently** if any of these apply:

| Filter | What to skip |
|--------|--------------|
| Inside `echo`/`printf`/`cat` arguments | `echo "curl X \| bash"`, `printf '%s' 'wget Y \| sh'` — the shell never executes the matched substring |
| Inside heredoc bodies fed to non-shell consumers | Anything between `<<EOF` / `<<-EOF` / `<<'EOF'` and the closing delimiter, when the heredoc is fed to `cat`, `echo`, a variable, or a usage function — only flag when fed to `bash`, `sh`, `eval`, or piped to a shell |
| Inside single- or double-quoted strings on RHS of assignment | `MSG="run: curl X \| bash"`, `JS_CODE='const x = eval(input)'`, `INSTRUCTIONS='see: wget Y \| sh'` — the string is data, not code |
| Inside object/dict literals as test/fixture data | `{"jsCode": "eval(item.json.code)"}` — the object value is a string sent to a remote system as workflow/test/fixture data, never parsed locally |
| Inside shell comments | Anything after `#` on a line (outside quoted strings) |
| Inside `usage()` / `help()` / `--help` output functions | Functions whose only effect is printing text to stderr/stdout |
| Inside markdown code fences in `.md` files | Already covered by the documentation-file rule above; reaffirm here |

A pattern is in executable position only when the shell or interpreter
would actually parse it as a command — not when it is a string the
program displays, returns, stores, or transmits. Apply this filter
BEFORE confidence assignment, not after; once a Critical/High finding
is emitted, the contribute path may ship it.

### Per-pattern guidance

**`SEC-curl-pipe-sh` / `download-then-execute`**:
- Match `curl ... | (bash|sh)` only when the curl invocation is at the
  start of a pipeline whose right-hand side is a shell, NOT when the
  pattern text appears as a quoted argument to another command.
- A `chmod +x file && ./file` immediately after a `curl -o file ...` IS
  executable; flag it. A `chmod +x` shown inside a usage heredoc is NOT;
  drop it.

**`SEC-new-function-eval` / `SEC-eval-with-variables`**:
- Match `eval(...)`, `new Function(...)`, `exec(...)` only when the call
  is in executable position. Verify by reading the surrounding 5 lines:
  if the match is the value of an object property, the body of a string
  literal, or fixture/test data being passed to a remote system, drop it.
- A `python3 -c "..."` block where the `-c` argument interpolates
  variables IS executable when the script runs locally; flag it.
- A string constant `jsCode: 'const result = eval(item.json.code);'`
  defined in test data destined for an external workflow runtime is NOT
  executable in the audited repo; drop it.

**`SEC-base64-decode-and-exec`**:
- Match `base64 -d | sh`, `base64.decode(...) | exec` only when the
  decoded output is fed to a local shell or interpreter. If the base64
  is a transport encoding for code sent to a remote sandbox/container
  (e.g., `printf X | base64 -d` where X is constructed locally and
  shipped via stdin to an E2B sandbox), the local audit has no exposure
  — drop it.

If a pattern is in executable position but is intentional and trusted
(e.g., a CI release script that pipes a known maintainer-controlled URL
to bash, or `python3 -c` interpolating values from `mktemp`/`stat`/internal
tools that cannot contain injection characters), mark it `false_positive: true`
with an `fp_reason` explaining the trust path. The reproduction gate at
the contribute step will drop it; the rule still gets the self-learning
signal.

## Public-by-Design Identifiers (drop SEC-hardcoded-api-key matches)

Many "API keys" embedded in client-side code are PUBLIC BY DESIGN —
they identify a project to a third-party SDK but carry no privileged
access. Flagging them as hardcoded secrets is a category error: the
maintainer cannot remove the value without breaking the integration,
and the value is already visible to any browser that visits the site.

**Drop `SEC-hardcoded-api-key` findings silently when ALL of these apply:**

| Filter | What to drop |
|--------|--------------|
| File is under `public/`, `static/`, `assets/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `_site/`, or other published-output directories | Anything served directly to browsers is, by construction, public. The maintainer can't make it private without redesigning the integration. |
| Key matches a known-public-by-design pattern | See list below. |
| Filename indicates client-side initialization (`posthog.js`, `gtag.js`, `analytics.js`, `mixpanel.js`, `sentry.js`, `clarity.js`, etc.) | Analytics SDKs require client-side identifiers to function. |

**Known-public-by-design key patterns:**

| Provider | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| PostHog | starts with `phc_` (project key) | `phc_xxxxx...` |
| PostHog | passed to `posthog.init(KEY, ...)` from a `<script>` tag | any value |
| Google Analytics | `G-XXXXXXX` (GA4 Measurement ID) | `G-1A2B3C4D5E` |
| Google Analytics | `UA-XXXXXX-X` (Universal Analytics) | `UA-12345-1` |
| Google Tag Manager | `GTM-XXXXXXX` | `GTM-ABCDE12` |
| Mixpanel | passed to `mixpanel.init(TOKEN)` from a `<script>` tag | any 32-hex |
| Sentry | DSN with `https://` prefix in browser-side code | `https://abc@o123.ingest.sentry.io/456` |
| Reo | `reo.js` clientID, passed to `Reo.init` | any value |
| Clarity | passed to `clarity.init` or `(c,l,a,r,i,t,y)` snippet | any value |
| Amplitude | passed to `amplitude.init(API_KEY, ...)` from `<script>` | any value |
| Hotjar | numeric `hjid` in `_hjSettings` | numeric |
| Segment | `analytics.load(WRITE_KEY)` from a `<script>` tag | any value |
| LogRocket | `LogRocket.init(APP_ID)` from a `<script>` tag | any value |
| Stripe | publishable key starts with `pk_live_` or `pk_test_` | `pk_live_xxxxx` |
| Algolia | `searchOnly` key in client config (not admin key) | any value |

**Public DSN/CSP-safe identifiers** in `meta` tags, `<script src>` URLs,
or ESM imports are also public by design.

**What still IS a finding** (never drop):

- Stripe **secret** keys (`sk_live_`, `sk_test_`)
- AWS access keys (`AKIA...`, `ASIA...`)
- GitHub PATs (`ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghu_`, `ghs_`, `ghr_`)
- OpenAI keys (`sk-...`, `sk-proj-...`)
- Anthropic keys (`sk-ant-...`)
- Database connection URLs with embedded credentials
- Private keys (`-----BEGIN ...PRIVATE KEY-----`)
- Twilio Auth Tokens, SendGrid API keys, etc. — server-side credentials
- Any key matched in a server-side path (`api/`, `server/`, `backend/`,
  `routes/`, `lib/server/`, files NOT under public output dirs)

The discipline: ask "if this key were swapped tomorrow, would the
end-user-visible product break?" If yes (analytics, tag managers,
SDK identifiers), it's public-by-design — drop. If no (auth, write
operations, admin endpoints), it's a real secret — flag.

Finding source: 2026-05-05 audit of `wasp-lang/open-saas` flagged 3
PostHog/Reo public keys in `opensaas-sh/blog/public/scripts/`. All 3
were self-marked `false_positive: true` by the scorer. Adding this filter prevents
the audit cycle from being burned on the same false positive shape.

## Finding Validation

After the pre-match filter, verify each surviving Critical or High result:
- Confirm the file is in an executable context (not documentation)
- Verify the pattern is reachable at runtime (not dead code behind a feature flag)
- Cross-reference with the project's test suite — a pattern in test fixtures is lower risk

## Report Format

The security scan section in an audit report follows this structure:

```
## Security Scan

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | N |
| High | N |
| Medium | N |
| Low | N |

### Findings

| # | Severity | File | Line | Pattern | Description |
|---|----------|------|------|---------|-------------|
```

## Risk Gate

If any Critical or High findings exist, the `contribute-approved` label must NOT be applied. The audit report must include a prominent warning and the tracking issue must link to the security findings.

## Scope Note

This skill covers the security-pattern catalog and risk-gate logic used by
the `security-scanner` agent. For the schemas of executable artifacts the
scanner inspects (hooks, scripts, MCP configs), see `nlpm:conventions`.
For the broader anti-pattern catalog covering NL-quality issues that are
not security risks, see `nlpm:patterns`.
