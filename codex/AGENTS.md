# nlpm — reference knowledge for Codex CLI

This Codex plugin ships nlpm's **reference-knowledge skills**: the 50 Rules of Natural Language Programming, the 100-point scoring rubric, per-tool conventions (Claude Code / Codex CLI / Antigravity), anti-patterns, the vocabulary discipline framework, and authoring guides for skills, agents, hooks, rules, plugins, and prompts.

These skills are knowledge, not commands. Load one when you need it — e.g. ask Codex to "score this skill against the nlpm rules" and it pulls in `$nlpm-rules` and `$nlpm-scoring`; ask "what's the Codex skill layout" and it pulls `$nlpm-conventions-codex`.

## What this plugin does NOT include

nlpm's interactive linting commands (`/nlpm:score`, `/nlpm:check`, `/nlpm:fix`, etc.) are **not** ported to Codex. Those commands orchestrate sub-agents via Claude Code's `Task()` dispatch, which has no in-skill equivalent in Codex. They remain a Claude Code plugin.

For deterministic checks without Claude Code (manifest-vs-disk consistency, frontmatter validity, hook event-name case) on **any** tool's artifacts, use the standalone Python validator:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/nlpm-check \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaolai/nlpm/main/bin/nlpm-check
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nlpm-check
nlpm-check .
```
