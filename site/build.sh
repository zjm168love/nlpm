# Build nlpm.com.
#
# 1. pnpm install (Vite needs node_modules early).
# 2. Re-generate the reference Markdown from canonical SKILL.md sources.
# 3. Sync case studies from /case-studies/ into site/case-studies/.
# 4. Copy JSON report sidecars from auditor/reports/*.json into
#    site/.vitepress/theme/data/{dashboard.json,reports/*.json}.
# 5. Generate one site/reports/<slug>.md per JSON sidecar; each mounts
#    <RepoReport> with its JSON data inline.
# 6. Vendor Lucide icons + write CNAME into site/public/ — these are
#    the only things in public/ now. The static dashboard.html and the
#    210 per-repo HTML files used to live here too, but VitePress's
#    Vue pages at /dashboard and /reports/<slug> are the canonical
#    online versions.
# 7. Run `pnpm build` (VitePress).
#
# Output: site/.vitepress/dist/
